# TimsInTheMiddle

## What it does
Using geolocation to find a midpoint which is then used to locate the nearest Tim Horton's for all users involved. It's ideal for arranging group meetings, setting up Kijiji meet-ups, and all the other miscellaneous activities which take place at Tim Horton's.

## Challenges I ran into
The Google Maps API that we used did not have the capability to find Tim Horton's locations beyond a certain distance. We then tried to do the same thing with the Yelp API but it was also limited in its search radius. Our goal was to be able to find a midpoint for Tim Horton's between the east and west coast, from the southern most tip of Canada to the north pole.

## Accomplishments that I'm proud of
- Completing 90% of the milestones we set out to do during the time limit of the hackathon (Hack the North 2016). 
- Building a strong foundation for a product that we hope to build on going into the future.
